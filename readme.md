Task Title: Implementing a Basic Inventory Management System

Task Description:
As a junior Java programmer, your task is to develop a basic command-line inventory management system for a small retail store. The system should allow users to perform various operations related to managing the store's inventory. The focus is on developing foundational programming skills and understanding core Java concepts.

Requirements:

    Item Class:
    Create a class named "Item" with the following attributes:
        Item ID (integer)
        Item Name (string)
        Quantity in Stock (integer)
        Price per Unit (double)

    Inventory Class:
    Create an "Inventory" class to manage the store's inventory using an ArrayList of Item objects. Implement the following methods:
        Add an item to the inventory.
        Remove an item from the inventory.
        Update the quantity of an existing item.
        Display the entire inventory with item details.

    Main Application:
    Develop a main application class that provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the inventory. The interface should allow users to:
        Add a new item to the inventory.
        Remove an item from the inventory.
        Update the quantity of an existing item.
        Display the current inventory.
        Exit the application.

    Input Validation:
    Implement basic input validation to handle invalid user inputs gracefully. For example, when updating the quantity, ensure that the input is a valid integer, and handle cases where the item is not found.

    Documentation:
    Include comments in your code to explain the purpose and functionality of classes, methods, and important code segments.

    Sample Data:
    Preload the inventory with a few sample items for testing purposes.

    Bonus (Optional):
    Implement a simple search functionality that allows users to search for items by name or ID.

Tips:

    Use appropriate data structures like ArrayList to store and manage the inventory.
    Break down the problem into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one.
    Test your code frequently with different scenarios to ensure it works as expected.

Submission:
Provide the complete Java source code along with any necessary files (if applicable) and a brief document explaining the design decisions you made and any challenges you faced during the implementation.

Note: This task is designed to help you practice core Java concepts such as class creation, object manipulation, data storage, input/output handling, and basic error handling.
